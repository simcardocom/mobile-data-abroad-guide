# How to Activate an eSIM  
  
Activating an eSIM typically involves scanning a QR code provided by your carrier or eSIM provider. For example, services like [Simcardo Travel eSIM Activation & Mobile Data](https://simcardo.com) guide you through purchasing and installing an eSIM profile. Once purchased, you scan the QR code in your phone's settings to download the eSIM profile, confirm activation, and ensure mobile data is enabled.
