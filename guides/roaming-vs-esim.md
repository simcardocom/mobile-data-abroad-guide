# Roaming vs. eSIM

This guide discusses the difference between using international roaming and purchasing a travel eSIM.

**International roaming** allows you to use your existing SIM card abroad by connecting to foreign networks. Roaming charges are often expensive and vary by carrier.

**Travel eSIMs** provide an alternative: you can purchase a local or global eSIM plan for your destination, which usually offers better rates and data packages.
