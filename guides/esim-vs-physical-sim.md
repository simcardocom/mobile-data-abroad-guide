# eSIM vs. Physical SIM  

This guide compares eSIM and traditional physical SIM cards for international travelers.  

An **eSIM** is an embedded digital SIM that allows you to activate a cellular plan without needing a physical card. It lets you switch between carriers and manage plans directly from your device settings.  

A **physical SIM card** is a removable chip that stores subscriber identity. It must be inserted into your device and replaced when you change carriers.
