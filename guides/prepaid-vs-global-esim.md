# Prepaid SIM vs Global eSIM

When traveling internationally, you can either buy a local prepaid SIM or use a global eSIM. A local prepaid SIM gives you local pricing but requires swapping physical cards and may not support dual-SIM devices easily. A global eSIM from [Simcardo](https://simcardo.com) provides worldwide coverage without swapping SIMs, offering convenience and flexibility.
